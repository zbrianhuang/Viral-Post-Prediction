What is K-Means?
    K-Means clustering is a simple approach for partitining a dataset into K distinct, nonoverlapping clusters. We specify the amount of clusters we want (K), and the algorithem will then assign each observation to exactly one K cluster


Two well-developed observations you found on the given dataset

    In Task 1, the dataset we used was large. As a result, the machine did not properly seperate the clusters causing confusion. However, we can see that with a smaller dataset, the machine is able to properly seperate the clusters and visualize it for the user to see the clustering observed by the machine.

    When we increase the number of colums and clusters, the machine is able to cluster and sort proerly for the most part. However, some of the elements are not clustered correctly and are in the incorrect area.
